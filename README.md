#An Intro to Front-End Driven App Solutions

This is the repo for my demo apps to back my talk about Front-End Driven / Static Web Apps for the April Front-End Orlando meetup.

I have chosen to show off the abilities of two Backends as a Service, [Parse](https://parse.com) & [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com), and an awesome open source project, [Hoodie](http://hood.ie).

I learned how to use Firebase and Parse from Codecademy's [API Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/apis).
